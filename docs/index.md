# What is 'Insight'?

Insight (_Inzicht_ in Dutch) is a **money management** feature designed to help our customers get a better **overview** of where they are **spending** their money. In Insight, customers can see an overview of different categories and subcategories in which they have spent or received money. This can be seen both on a monthly and yearly basis. If a customer finds a transaction was placed in the wrong category, they can **recategorise** this single transaction to a more fitting category, or even recategorise all historical and **future** transactions to that counterparty.
